Test api for handling funds in a bank

This api is used to create clients, funds and link or unlink clients to funds

# Back-end Technology
For this API I use python because it is a programming language that is among the most widely used today, also because of its dynamism, speed and ease of carrying out processes and connecting to databases.

Additionally because I already have a lot of experience with it.

# Database Technology
For the database, a NoSQL database was chosen, given the given requirements, the database is MongoDB, one of the best non-relational databases that exists.

For the implementation, MongoDB atlas is used as a cluster.

you can find a diagram of the database in this folder

# Tecnical considerations
